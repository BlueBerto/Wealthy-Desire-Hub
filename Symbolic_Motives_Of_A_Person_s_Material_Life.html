                    <h2>Status</h2>
                    <p>It is believed by many people that they could attain a sense of recognition or achievement from using and owning the right kind of product. This can be an important motivator of behavior. Materialism basically lies on the ownership and acquisition of items that are aligned in achieving major life goals. A person’s status may increase consumption and can motivate behavior.</p>
                    <p>EXAMPLE</p>
                    <p>In certain societies, jewelry symbolizes social status and prosperity, making it a visible indicator of one's wealth and desirability. This belief underscores the cultural significance placed on outward displays of affluence, where expensive jewelry is seen not just as adornment but as a strategic statement in attracting potential suitors. Historically, lavish accessories have been intertwined with notions of power and allure, shaping perceptions of beauty and success in relationships.</p>

						<p>When it comes to spending, some people choose more expensive items or those with well-known branding and latest features to increase their status. For instance, one will buy a flat screen television of a known brand, with the latest features merely because it has a higher price than other models.  </p>
						<h2>Affective Motive</h2>
						<p>This is a concept used in Environmental Psychology. Affect or emotions are the basis of pro-environmental behavior and buying behavior. Thus, incorporating the affective motive results in people buying the goods not only because they think they need it but because of how it affects them which could be the joy or happiness they get after buying the goods they wanted.</p>	
						<h2>Materialism</h2>
						<p>refers to having the need to find material possessions imperative to one’s life. A person is materialistic when he or she finds the ownership of material possessions more important than other things.  </p>

				<h2>The Role of Material Possessions on the Sense of Self and Identity </h2>
				
				<!-- New boxes with text content -->
				<div class="row mt-4">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<div class="box">
							<h5>Good</h5>
							<p>Material possessions are comparable to the self's objective manifestation. The quantity of material possessions that people have remains valuable because these are symbolic of one’s social status and personal success. Cars, clothes, and houses are to some the most valuable possessions because they are the most visible in the eyes of others. These items not only reflect wealth but also taste and style, further enhancing one’s image. The more expensive and luxurious the items are, the more people are to pay attention to them.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<div class="box">
							<h5>Bad</h5>
							<p>The desires for material possessions also have negative effects on one's sense of self and identity. Material possessions not being owned or being too little can affect one’s mental health like people being affected by calamities and losing their hard-earned luxuries. People also tend to look through a person just by their possessions. The higher the number of material possessions, the higher the possibility of a person to be completely accepted and treated nicely by other people.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="ab_content">
					<h2>Consumer culture</h2>
					<p>is a kind of social system where consumption is filled with the use of commercial products. Consumerism is the use of material goods and services outside one's basic needs. Consumerism is very much alike with materialism; they both heavily impact the way individuals view the self: negatively or positively. People tend to be joyful and motivated whenever they get their needs and wants. On the other hand, this encourages excessive buying, where the state of needs and wants are endless. Thus, could cause negative effects such as dissatisfaction and/or depression.</p>	
					<h2>The Role of Consumer Culture on the Sense of Self and Identity</h2>
					<p>Consumer Identity is a person’s pattern of consumption. People ordinarily do not consume goods and services for their functional satisfaction. Nowadays, it has become more meaning based. Brands are now used as symbolic resources in order to build and maintain one’s identity. They may construct their social identities by the consumption of luxury and commercial brands. The people’s response to goods and services are done by choice or by compulsion with regards to the assumptions associated to their social identities.</p>
